                    Recent research shows that CHIP mutations carry significant risk of developing a wide spectrum of
                    common blood-related ailments. These include cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic liver disease,
                    and autoimmune diseases. In some cases, the increased risk factor can be as much as fifty-fold. A
                    deeper understanding of CHIP and somatic mosaicism allows us to identify the risks for these
                    devastating diseases at earlier stages than ever before. It also opens doors to new drug target
                    discoveries, while enhancing our ability to identify patients who need these therapies most, and who
                    will respond best to tailored treatments. Eventually, we hope to reach the point when we can prevent
                    some diseases entirely. This is especially important given that cardiovascular disease and cancer
                    remain the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in today’s aging population.
